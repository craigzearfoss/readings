### 1. Get a good Linter set up.

- [**ESLint**](https://eslint.org/)
- [eslint-config-airbnb](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript/tree/master/packages/eslint-config-airbnb) is a great configuration.

### 2. User prop-types and default props.

- If your component has a propType that is not required it should have a default prop.

### 3. Know when to make new components.

### 4. Know when to use components vs. pure components vs. stateless functional components.

- This can affect your performance by unnecessary re-renders.
- Linting can help with this.

### 5. Use **React DevTools**.

### 6. Use inline and ternary statements to make your code more readable.

- Do not use inline if you have a huge condition that makes it hard to read.

### 7.Use snippet libraries.

- They save time when creating new components.
- They inform you of good React syntax.

### 8. Learn how React works.

- Learn how the internals of React work.
- A good resource is [React Internals by Matt Greer](https://www.mattgreer.org/articles/react-internals-part-one-basic-rendering/).
