## PHP
- Almost strictly used for web development.
- More popular when it comes to web applications.
- Used by large companies.
- Syntax:
	- PHP can be VERY messy.
	- Too much freedom can be a bad thing.
- Learning curve:
	- Too many ways to do the same thing which can be confusing.
	- Not very secure by default.
- Frameworks and CMS:
	- Laravel, Symfony, Slim, Codeigniter, CakePHP
	- PHP dominates the world of package management.
- Package Manager:
	- Composer
- Deployment and Hosting:
	- Easiest and cheapest to deploy and host.
	- You can use any shared host, etc.

## Python
- Used for web development and as a general programming language.
- Getting more popular in general.
- Used by large companies.
- Syntax:
	- Clean, elegant and more readable syntax.
	- Uses indentation over curly braces (could be good or bad)
- Learning curve:
	- Clear path for learning but has a broad range of syntax.
	- Also used for harder things in general.
- Frameworks and CMS:
	- Django, Flask, WebPy2, Pylons
- Package Manager:
	- PIP
- Deployment and Hosting:
	- Takes a bit more to set up
	- Suggest clouad hosting like Digital Ocean, Linode, Heroku or AWS.


## Bottom Line
- Figure out what your want to do. (web apps, data, AI, etc.)
- Run through a few simple tutorials of both to see what you grasp and what you enjoy.
- Read and watch more videos like this to get other perspectives.
- Build something simple with both.
- Pick one and run with it until you're making 6 figures.
