## Describing Systems

- **Number of variables** - Few <-----> Many
- **Type of system rules** - Linear (Static) <> Non-Linear (Dynamic)
- **Predictability of states** - Deterministic <> Non-deterministic
  - Anytime yo put a human into a system it becomes unpredictable.
- **Adaptability of the system** - Non-adaptive <> Adaptive

## Types of Systems

- **Simple**
  - Few variable., simple rules, deterministic, non-adaptive
  - Easy to understand and use
- **Complicated**
  - Many variables, simple rules, deterministic, non-adaptive
  - Hard to understand and use
  - Many interface components, content elements, and steps
  - Systems of many parts
- **Complex**
  - Many variables, dynamic, non-deterministic, adaptive
  - Hard to underdtand, individual components are easy to use
  - Many relationships, connections, workflows, and paths
  - System of interacting systems
- **Chaotic**
  - Few variables. dynamic, non-deterministic, adaptive
  - Emergent properties, sensitive to perturbation
  - It's hard to predict what is going to come out.

### What about chaotic systems?

## Chaotic systems

- They appear to have an **impossibly large** number of variables, but can actually be describes and understood with **remarkably few**.
- Weather modeling is an example of a simple model, chaotic system.
  - The Lorenz equations model atmospheric convection. The equations are simple, but he weather is unpredictable.
    - d*x*/d*t* = _σ_(_y_ - _x_)
    - d*y*/d*t* = _x_(_ρ_ - _z_) - _y_
    - d*z*/d*t* = _xy_ - _βz_
  - A little change can produce massive changes in the future but we don't know when those changes will occur.
  - They are bounded systems.
  - We don't know where it will be at any point beyond the near future so we can't predict.
- We cannot simplify chaos.
- We cannot make chaos predictable.
- Chaos is a sign of a healthy system because they can heal, adjust and change.

### Sometimes systems are naturally complex.

### Too often they are complicated.

### We can do something about it, but how did they get that way?

- Start
- "Oh, by the way..."
- "Wouldn't it be cool if..."
- "Looks good. Now let's..."
- "The system doesn't..."
- Feature Complete!

### A few ways products may become complicated...

- **Poor design methods**
  - Lack of design and research
  - Mental model mismatch
  - Mis-applied design patterns
- **Poor product management**
  - Scope creep (or run or jog)
  - Executive bungee jumping
  - Unrealistic deadlines and time limits
- **Technical issues**
  - Inadequate technology
  - Inadequate materials
  - Incorrect or mis-matched technology
- **Constraints and requirements**
  - Legal and regulatory requirements
  - Business and financial model (costs and revenue)
  - Conflicting needs, conditions, and solutions

### Complication occurs gradually.

### Before you decide to make it simpler realize that not everything should be simple.

### When might simplicity not be a goal?

- If it is too fast and too easy...
  - ... mistakes or errors may become more likely?
  - ... some inadvertant interactions may be irreversible?
  - ... people my not adequately understand their actions and outcomes?
  - ... people my not learn and remember important information and actions?
  - ... products may be easier to misuse or subvert or mislead?
  - ... there may be unintended or unforeseen consequences?

### The goals for simplicity mush be balances.

- **Reduce** effort, stress, waste, and errors.
- **Enhance** meaningfulness, value, quality, and wellbeing.
- **Help** people learn, create,share,solve, decide, and remember.

### People want to feel **effective**, **intelligent**, and **confident**.

### "Make everything as simple as possible, but no simpler." - Albert Einstein

### How much detail is necessary?

### **Law of Parsimony**

- Also known as **Occam's Razor**.
- All things being equal, simpler solutions are generally better than complicated ones.

### A sufficiently motivated person will tolerate and inordinate amount of crap.

- If you have competitors or your customers don't actual need it then you shouldn't leave it "as-is".
- What are your options.
  1. **As-is** - Make no changes after you have completed.
  2. **Clarity** - Make a superficial pass and clean up the design and content a little.
  3. **Structure** - Make some of changes to the underlying structure.
  4. **Flow** - Change how people move through the product and use it.

### After you have achieved feature complete ...

- Yes, we still need to simplify.
- We often overlook and miss the opportunities to simplify.

### What are some signs of unnecessary complication?

1. Designing for yourself (You are not the user.)
2. Leading with technology (A solution looking for a problem, solving the wrong problem.)
3. Map product structure to organization or technology (Exposes system model, incorrect flows, irrelevant needs)
4. Product by consensus (Scope creep, diluted focus, disconnected features)
5. Accepting assumptions (absence of critical thinking, introduces bias, failure to test)
6. Copying others (introduce irrelevance, applications of anti-patterns)
7. Indirect action (abstracted, disconnected, increased cognitive load)
8. Shifting effort to users (it's our job to do as much of the user's work as possible)
9. "Messy and confusing" (disorganization, ambiguity, irrelevance, no focus)
10. "Would be nice to have" (clutter, noise, distraction)
11. Everything to everyone (too many features, content, and goals with no priorities)
12. "Just in case..." (increases choices, slows decisions, does not guide or help)

### What can we do to reduce unnecessary complication?

### Foundational Design Method

- Start with these...
- **Identify, define, and frame**
  - Be clear about the problems you are solving and which user tasks and goals you are satisfying.
- **User-centered design methods**
  - Use mental models, task flows, critical user journeys, scenarios, empathy, observation, and more.
- **Critical thinking**
  - Recognize assupmtions, assess relationships, and consider consequences.
- **Iterate!**
  - Test, refine, optimize, polish, and repeat.

### Product design phases

1. **Structure** - What are the parts and how are they connected?
2. **Flow** - How should the parts be connected so that people can move through them to achieve the things that they need to do?
3. **Interface** - The point of interaction.

### The decisions that you make at early stages influence the decisions that you make in later stages.

- We do research the whole way along.
- Sometimes we will make a decision that will affect something early.
- Iteration is okay

### Methods to simplify

- **Subtract** (remove, reduce)
  - Can we remove redundant or superfluous information, actions, and steps or stages?
- **Consolidation** (merge, join)
  - Can we combine redundant or similary information and/or actions without losing the essential information anr/or actions?
  - Can we combine multiple things into fewer things?
- **Redistribute** (move, split)
  - Can we re-arrange the sequence, or location of information and/or actions?
  - Can we convert a few large steps into more, smaller steps?
- **Prioritize** (rand, rate)
  - Can we make information and/or actions more or less prominent by adjusting the position, sequence, or presentation?
- **Clarify** (organize, reframe)
  - Can we change the way information and/or actions are framed and represented to improve clarity and meaningfulness without lsoing the essential information and/or actions?

### Some considerations

#### Simplicity lives within the complicated.

- **Law of Conservation or Complexity**
  - **complexity moves** - It takes on different forms in different locations.

#### Design often just moves the complication

- **Simplifying in one area may increase complication in another**, even if the methods for simplification are properly applied.

#### Perception vs. Measurement

- **Experiences may feel simpleer if they..**
  - reduce cognitive load and friction
  - reduce ambiguity
  - increase confidence
  - increase relevance
  - increase meaningfulness
- **even if they...**
  - take longer
  - use more words
  - have more steps
  - require more attention and thought
  - are split across multiple areas

#### Value vs. Pain

- The value of the outcome must be greater than the cost of the time and effort.
- **Predictability & Confidence**
  - People make predications about the outcomes their actions may preoduce _before_ the interact.

```
                  V(outcome)
P(interaction) = ------------ X C(prediction)
                  W(effort)
The probability of interaction is the product of the value / pain ratio
for the outcome and the confidence level of the prediction.
```

#### Motivation and Tolerance

- Just because people interact, does not mean that they are confident in their actions.

#### Simple metrics may not tell the whole story.

- **Counting interactions** is not always a measure of intent or purpose.
- **Duration or interaction** is not always a measure of engagement.
- **Task completion rate** does not always mean it was easy of enjoyable.

## Feature complete is _not_ experience optimized.

## Simplification is _not_ easy, but it _is_ possible.
