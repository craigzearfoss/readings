## Describing Systems

- **Number of variables** - Few <-----> Many
- **Type of system rules** - Linear (Static) <> Non-Linear (Dynamic)
- **Predictability of states** - Deterministic <> Non-deterministic
  - Anytime yo put a human into a system it becomes unpredictable.
- **Adaptability of the system** - Non-adaptive <> Adaptive

## Types of Systems

- **Simple**
  - Few variable., simple rules, deterministic, non-adaptive
  - Easy to understand and use
- **Complicated**
  - Many variables, simple rules, deterministic, non-adaptive
  - Hard to understand and use
  - Many interface components, content elements, and steps
  - Systems of many parts
- **Complex**
  - Many variables, dynamic, non-deterministic, adaptive
  - Hard to underdtand, individual components are easy to use
  - Many relationships, connections, workflows, and paths
  - System of interacting systems
- **Chaotic**
  - Few variables. dynamic, non-deterministic, adaptive
  - Emergent properties, sensitive to perturbation
  - It's hard to predict what is going to come out.

### What about chaotic systems?

## Chaotic systems

- They appear to have an **impossibly large** number of variables, but can actually be describes and understood with **remarkably few**.
- Weather modeling is an example of a simple model, chaotic system.
  - The Lorenz equations model atmospheric convection. The equations are simple, but he weather is unpredictable.
    - d*x*/d*t* = _σ_(_y_ - _x_)
    - d*y*/d*t* = _x_(_ρ_ - _z_) - _y_
    - d*z*/d*t* = _xy_ - _βz_
  - A little change can produce massive changes in the future but we don't know when those changes will occur.
  - They are bounded systems.
  - We don't know where it will be at any point beyond the near future so we can't predict.
- We cannot simplify chaos.
- We cannot make chaos predictable.
- Chaos is a sign of a healthy system because they can heal, adjust and change.

### Sometimes systems are naturally complex.

### Too often they are complicated.
