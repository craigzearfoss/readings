1. Large diffs
	- Keep commits small.
	- Submit targeted small pieces of code one at a time.
	- People can make sure you're on the right track.
	- It's easier to get approval.
2. Over-engineered garbage code
	- Tangled code, huge functions, tons of if statements, random helper methods, premature optimization, etc
	- The way the code is set up is important even if it works.
	- Write a design document first to organize your ideas.
3. Slow effectiveness
	- Don't just code for coding sake.
	- Make sure that your code can be shipped.
	- Keep track of your APM (Actions per Minute).
	- Avoid distractions.
	- Try to get at least one piece of code submitted per day.
4. Pride / Ego / Arrogance
	- Causes engineers to overengineer their code to make it look smart.
	- Swallow your pride and ask for help when you need it.
5. Identify and respect the dev lead
	- Be nice to the tech lead
	- Little tricks
		- Instead of you submitting code send a diff patch to the tech lead for him to submit.
		- Put the tech leads name in design documents
